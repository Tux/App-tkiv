# NAME

App::tkiv - An image viewer in Perl::Tk based on IrfanView

# SYNOPSIS

    $ iv [-v[#]] [-f] [-1|-s] [option=value ...] [dir]

    $ iv -f imageposition=s thumsorting=size .

# DESCRIPTION

`iv` is a pure-perl application that was written to mimic the behavior
of the image view and manipulation program `irfanview`, which is available
as freeware on Windows.

Linux already offers many free image view and manipulation programs, but
none gave me the key-driven approach that I liked in IrfanView, and most
left traces of what was viewed in hidden files (thumbnail previews etc).

`iv` is not written to be a _better_ image viewer. It is written to
prove such an application can be written in perl and still is fast and
versatile enough to need my (own) needs.

`iv` is not aiming for a complete rewrite of IrfanView.

# Command Line Arguments

- -v\[#\]

    Set verbose level. Default value is 0. A plain -v without value will set
    the level to 1.

- -f

    Start in full-screen mode. Thumbnail view will not be full-screen, but the
    displayed images will. This overrules the default option from .ivrc files.

- -s

    Start the slideview on open automatically.

- -1

    After populating the thumbnail view, immediately display the first image
    and minimize the thumbnail view.

## Options

Options are case insensitive. They are read from /etc/iv.rc, /etc/.ivrc,
~/iv.rc, ~/.ivrc, ./iv.rc, ./.ivrc, image\_dir/iv.rc and image\_dir/.ivrc
(in that order if available).

Not (yet) local per dir, so the last one read stays active and overrules
the previous settings.

    thumbSize           => 80,          # in pixels
        size of the thumbnails in the thumbview. default 80x80

    thumbRows           => 5,
        number of rows in the thumbview. default 5

    thumbPosition       => "se",
        position of the thumbview on the screen. default se (bottom right)
        possible values: n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw, c

    thumbRefresh        => 1,
        when deleting images, the thumb preview is also deleted, and all
        thumbs then have to be re-displayed in order to fill the gap. When
        deleting images out of a long sequence, this will take a long time.
        Disabling the refresh will make the cleanup procedure go faster,
        but will cause errors/warnings when you re-visit the thumb that
        has been deleted

    thumbSorting        => "default",
        defines the ordering of the thumbnails in the thumbview.

        default : on the numeric part of the image name, then on the full name
        caseless: on the lower-cased image name
        date    : on mtime
        size    : on (file) size
        random  : random

    thumbSortOrder      => "ascending",
        ordering of the thumbs. default ascending. possible values ascending
        or descending

    imagePosition       => "nw",
        position of the image window. default nw (top-left)
        possible values: n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw, c

    imageDir            => ".",
        default image dir (current folder)

    slideShowDelay      => 1500,        # in milliseconds
        in slide shows, define the display time for each image. default: 1500 ms

    slidePosition       => "c",
        position of the full image in slide-show mode. default c (center)
        possible values: n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw, c

    slideFull           => 0,
        display images auto-fit in slide-show mode. default 0 (off)

    slideCover          => 0,
        EXPERIMENTAL
        cover the background when in slideshow mode

    titleDirs           => 0
        The number of dir levels (counted from the end) that should be included
        in the image title

    titleIndex          => 0
        display the index of the image in the image title. (default off)
        When on, the title of the image window is extended with " n/N", where
        n is the index and N is the total number of images in the current
        thumb-view

    maxX                => 9999,
        maximum horizontal resolution (some size quests are unreliable)

    maxY                => 9999,
        maximum vertical resolution (some size quests are unreliable)

    smallFont           => "{Liberation Mono} 8",",
        define the font for labels

    selectionFont       => "{Liberation Sans} 5",
        the font used to display information with the selection rectangle

    selectionColor      => "Yellow",
        the color used when drawing selection rectangles

    confirmDelete       => 1,
        ask for confirmation when deleting images. default 1 (true)

    removeTarget        => 0,
        remove target folder when it is empty. default 0 (false)

    imageFull           => 0,
        show images full-screen. default 0 (off). Full-screen resizes the
        image to automatically fit the screen height or screen-width when
        maintaining aspect ratio. Also sometimes called auto-fit.

    lastFirstNext       => 0,
        If set will cause keys_nextpic on the last pic to open the first
        pic of the next set as if keys_firstnext was used

    showExifInfo        => 0,
        show a summary of the exif info of the image on the image

    exifInfoColor       => "Blue",
        the color if the exif info text on the image for showexifinfo

    decoration          => 1,
        show the screen control elements. Default 1 (on). Some window
        managers support full control, either by keys or mouse, even when
        the borders and title bar are gone. Some refuse to do scroll bars
        and such when the decoration is disabled. YMMV

    scrollSpeed         => 3,
        The default scroll increments for Tk::Canvas is a bit too course
        for fine-grained scrolling. A low value enables precise positioning
        with the scroll wheel, high values scroll fast.

    dirTreeStartPos     => 0.,
        The initial position of the dir tree view relative from the top.
        The default is to show the top of the tree if there is more than
        the current window to be viewed and a scrollbar is shown. Setting
        dirTreeStartPos to 1. will show the bottom of the tree on startup.
        A value of .5 will show the middle.

## Key bindings

For manipulation (resizing, rotation, ...) the external command `convert`
from ImageMagick is used.

# TODO

- save/load from .ivrc buttons on option window
- Slideshow

        - behavior: location, dir depth, cycling
        - randomness, slide lists, full screen background (no decoration)
        - playlist
        - loop control
        - Auto-sense image load time for slideshows

- Image manipulation

        - selection less picky
        - selection from zoom other than original
        - Save, Save as ...

- Titles and decoration behavior

        - adjust height/width of screen-fit images to decoration
          (I just cannot get $iv->overrideredirect (1) to work as I want)

- Tree view

        - Hide dirs above dt root
        - Allow a set of dirs from the command line
        - Make pirstnext and firstprev look in the original folder if the
          image folder actually been viewed is a symlink in the parent folder

- Animation

        - use Tk::Animation for animated gif's

- Menu's
- Documentation
- Portability

        - make image format's optional (TIFF, NEF, ...)
